# Windows 11 Setup Checklist

## Productivity and Accessibility

- [ ] Install [Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org/) (consider using latest unstable. Latest stable is from 2017!)
  - Set Regional keyboard shortcut to Ctrl-Shift-Alt-PrintScreen so builtin print screen still works
  - Create folder Screenshots in Desktop and set output folder to this to keep screenshots together
    
- [ ] Use PowerToys FancyZones instead of Windows 11 Snap Layouts  
  <details>
    <summary>Disable Windows 11 Snap suggestions and layouts</summary>
    
    - Go to Windows Settings System Multitasking
      ```
      ms-settings:multitasking
      ```

    - Untick the unneeded checkboxes. Don't disable Snap itself, as without it you cannot drag the titlebar of a maximized window!

    - Open Registry Editor
    - Go to
      
      ```

      ```
